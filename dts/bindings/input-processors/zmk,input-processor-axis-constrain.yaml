  Once movement exceeds the threshold, only horizontal or vertical axis
  is allowed based on the initial movement direction.

  threshold:
    type: int
    default: 5
    description: |
      Movement threshold before axis direction is determined.
      The axis is locked once cumulative movement exceeds this value.

  sticky:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      When enabled, locks the axis until movement stops.
      When disabled, axis is determined per movement event.

  release-after-ms:
    type: int
    default: 100
    description: |
      Timeout in milliseconds to release axis lock when sticky mode is enabled.
      After this period of no movement, the axis lock is released.
